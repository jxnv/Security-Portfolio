-- Description: Detects the enabling of the Windows Recall feature via registry manipulation. Windows Recall can be enabled by setting the value of "DisableAIDataAnalysis" to "0".
-- Adversaries may enable Windows Recall as part of post-exploitation discovery and collection activities.
-- This rule assumes that Recall is already explicitly disabled on the host, and subsequently enabled by the adversary.
